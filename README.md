## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing sales data to uncover insights that can help improve business performance. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization, and data analytics.

## Objectives

- Clean and preprocess raw sales data.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and patterns.
- Visualize key metrics using charts and graphs.
- Use statistical analysis.

## Dataset source: Kaggle

The dataset consists of sales transactions recorded over a period of time. The key features include:unnamed:0,order_id	,product	,quantity	,price_each	,order_date	,purchase_address	,month	,sales_amount	,city	, 
 ,hour

## Tools & Technologies

The analysis is performed using:

- **Python** (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn,)
- 
## Steps Involved

1. **Data Collection**: Gather raw sales data from multiple sources.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, duplicate records, and outliers.
3. **EDA**: Perform descriptive analysis, correlation analysis, and trend identification.
4. **Data Visualization**: Generate charts (bar charts, line graphs, histograms, heatmaps) for insights.
5. **Insights**: Provide insights based on analysis.

## Insights

- The Macbook Pro Laptop stands out as the highest-performing product, contributing the most to total sales.
- Both AAA Batteries (4-pack) and AA Batteries (4-pack) emerge as top-selling products by quantity, followed by charging cables.
- The products ranking highest in terms of "quantity" are positioned at the bottom in total sales, attributed to their lower pricing compared to other items in the product range.
- San Francisco leads in sales, contributing the highest revenue, followed by Los Angeles and New York City. The data underscores the significant market presence in major metropolitan areas.
- The data shows a seasonal pattern, with peak sales in October, November, and December, reflecting increased consumer spending during the holiday season. Following the holiday season, a decline in sales is observed, indicating diminished consumer activity post-holidays.
- The overall trend shows a slight increase from Monday to Tuesday, followed by relatively consistent sales throughout the rest of the week.
- Sales peak during late morning to early afternoon, notably between 10 AM and 2 PM, and again from 5 PM to 8 PM. This insight is crucial for refining staffing and marketing strategies, enabling the business to enhance customer service by ensuring adequate staffing during peak hours.
